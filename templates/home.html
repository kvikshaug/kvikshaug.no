      <p>I am a senior software engineer located in Copenhagen, Denmark. I am a co-founder of <a href="https://unseenbio.com">Unseen Bio</a>, a biotech company specializing in analyzing gut microbiome conditions, bringing users personalized feedback to improve health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>As I worked for some years on the <a href="http://dd-decaf.eu/">DD-DeCaF research project</a>, we built a unique tool which brings computer-aided design into the realm of metabolic engineering. In an endeavour to bring our cutting-edge research to industry, we participated in the <a href="https://bioinnovationinstitute.com/news/meet-the-start-ups-metabolizer/">Business Acceleration Academy</a> at the BioInnovation Institute in Copenhagen, resulting in <a href="https://youtu.be/v0OykuR2JbA?t=4127">Metabolyzer</a>, which has since <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6648974668948615168/">joined forces with Unseen Bio</a>.</p>
      <p>Previously, I was part of the <a href="https://www.dnt.no/">Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT)</a>, an organization promoting mountain hiking in the <a href="https://ut.no">majestic Norwegian outdoors</a>. I was a system architect and core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/Turistforeningen">a number of their open source projects</a>.</p>
      <p>I promote open source and personally run a handful of small side projects. Most of these are published on <a href="https://gitlab.com/kvikshaug">gitlab</a> or <a href="https://github.com/kvikshaug">github</a>, and every so often I participate in Q&amp;A on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/302484/kvikshaug">stack overflow</a>. Other open source projects I have contributed to include <a href="https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy">cobrapy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/opencobra/memote">memote</a>, a genome-scale metabolic model test suite <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0446-y">published in Nature Biotechnology</a>. A presentation of my humble career in academia is available on <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2805-310X">ORCID</a>.</p>
      <p>Although I'm not actively looking for new work at the moment, I am always open to discuss new opportunities.

      <p>Some of my life-long passions include <a href="https://vimeo.com/53413403">snowboarding</a>, <a href="assets/images/splitboard.webp">splitboarding</a>, cross-country skiing and <a href="https://ut.no/">mountain hiking</a>. It's not all outdoors and adrenaline though; I try to make time to read books, and have accumulated a <a href="https://oku.club/user/kvikshaug/collection/favorites-L1pah">short list of favorites</a>. Additionally, I've loved playing <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/kvikshaug">video games</a> since I was 5 years old, and at this point, I don't think I will ever outgrow them.</p>
      <p>I have a pragmatic approach to software engineering. In my early years, I took great pride in my craft. I saw an intrinsic value in expressing computational logic in various elegant, complex ways that different programming languages offer. However, with time, I came to realize a crucial fact in software development: Code is much harder to read than it is to write. Today, although I still can appreciate the beauty in a well written application, I see software as a means to an end, and value documentation, readability and maintainability - and if a problem can be solved without writing a single line of code, that is often what I will advocate.</p>
