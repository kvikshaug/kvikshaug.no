        I am a senior software engineer located in Copenhagen, Denmark. I am a co-founder of <a href="https://unseenbio.com">Unseen Bio</a>, a fast-growing biotechnology startup specializing in analyzing gut microbiome conditions, bringing users personalized feedback to improve health and wellbeing.

      <p>As I worked for some years on the <a href="http://dd-decaf.eu/">DD-DeCaF research project</a>, we built a unique tool which brings computer-aided design into the realm of metabolic engineering. In an endeavour to bring our cutting-edge research to industry, we participated in the <a href="https://bioinnovationinstitute.com/news/meet-the-start-ups-metabolizer/">Business Acceleration Academy</a> at the BioInnovation Institute in Copenhagen, resulting in <a href="https://youtu.be/v0OykuR2JbA?t=4127">Metabolyzer</a>, which has since <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6648974668948615168/">joined forces with Unseen Bio</a>.</p>
      <p>Previously, I was part of the <a href="https://www.dnt.no/">Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT)</a>, an organization promoting mountain hiking in the <a href="https://ut.no">majestic Norwegian outdoors</a>. I was a system architect and core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/Turistforeningen">a number of their open source projects</a>.</p>
      <p>Other open source projects I have contributed to include <a href="https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy">COBRApy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opencobra/memote">memote</a>, a genome-scale metabolic model test suite <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0446-y">published in Nature Biotechnology</a>. A presentation of my modest career in academia is available on <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2805-310X">ORCID</a>.</p>
      <p>Some of my life-long passions include <a href="https://vimeo.com/53413403">snowboarding</a>, <a href="/assets/images/splitboard.webp">splitboarding</a>, cross-country skiing and <a href="https://ut.no/">mountain hiking</a>. It's not all outdoors and adrenaline though; I try to make time to read books, and have accumulated a <a href="https://oku.club/user/kvikshaug/collection/favorites-L1pah">short list of favorites</a>. Additionally, I've loved playing <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/kvikshaug">video games</a> since I was 5 years old, and at this point, I don't think I will ever outgrow them.</p>
      <p>Did you know that there exists galaxies we can see, but never interact with because they're <abbr title="Due to the expansion of spacetime geometry.">receding from us faster than light</abbr>? No signal we send can ever reach them. If some of them harbor life, it is physically impossible for us to <em>ever</em> interact with those lifeforms. They're on their own, and so are we. Yeah, stop and consider that for a moment. Now let's solve <abbr title="Faster than light.">FTL</abbr> travel!</p>
