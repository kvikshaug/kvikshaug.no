It's not all outdoors and adrenaline though; I try to make time to read books, and have accumulated a <a href="https://oku.club/user/kvikshaug/collection/favorites-L1pah">short list of favorites </a>. Additionally, I've loved playing <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/kvikshaug">video games</a> since I was 5 years old, and at this point, I don't think I will ever outgrow them.</p>
        <p>I'm generally active in open source and have been <a href="https://github.com/kvikshaug">part of GitHub's ubiquitous git hosting service</a> since 2009. However, after Microsoft's acquisition in 2018, my feelings about the platform are lukewarm. GitLab is a serious contender in the DevOps platform space and currently <a href="https://gitlab.com/kvikshaug">my default choice for new projects</a>. Sourcehut is also an appealing, minimalistic software development platform, and an interesting alternative to the bigger players. I'm also somewhat active on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/story/kvikshaug">Stack Overflow</a>, the definitive Q&amp;A site for developers. Admittedly, I have more Qs than As, but hey, at some point we have enough Jon Skeets.</p>

No signal we send can ever reach them. If some of them harbor life, it is physically impossible for us to <em>ever</em> interact with those lifeforms. They're on their own, and so are we.

              Role: Chief Information Officer
            </p>
            <p>Unseen Bio is a fast-growing biotechnology startup which specializes in analyzing the gut microbiome, providing unique personalized insight into the health and composition of your gut.</p>
            <p>We are 5 co-founders with a broad set of competences who came together to execute on a novel approach to gut microbiome analysis. By applying the technology from the <a href="#dd-decaf">DD-DeCaF project</a> to the promising and rapidly advancing field of the gut microbiome, we found that we were in a position to generate a vastly improved and much more personalized picture of the microbiome, than what has been possible before.</p>
            <p>To this aim, we built a unique interactive visualization of the microbiome and how it compares to a healthy reference gut. We then apply metabolic software to build a complete network model of each individual microbiome and the interactions between the different bacteria in that community. With this model, we can make useful predictions of how dietary changes will affect the microbiome positively or negatively.</p>
            <p>The service is fully translated to Danish, German and English, and is available in Europe. Read more on <a href="https://unseenbio.com">unseenbio.com</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://memote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Memote</a> (the <strong>me</strong>tabolic <strong>mo</strong>del <strong>te</strong>st suite) is a tool to analyze and score the quality of genome-scale metabolic models.

            <p>In close collaboration with the authors of Memote, I built an <a href="https://memote.io">online service</a> to help promote the tool and make it accessible to anyone with a browser. The service uses the <a href="https://github.com/opencobra/memote">official package</a> and allows visitors to upload any metabolic model to be analyzed in our preconfigured online environment, and eventually receive a full report without having to install the application locally.</p>
            <p>In the same period, I also made a <a href="https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy/commits?author=kvikshaug">handful of contributions</a> to <a href="https://github.com/opencobra/cobrapy">COBRApy</a>, memote's underlying tool for constraint-based modeling.</p>
            <p>Memote was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0446-y">published in Nature Biotechnology</a> in 2020. A presentation of my modest career in academia is available on <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2805-310X">ORCID <i class="fab fa-orcid"></i></a>.</p>

            <p>I was a senior developer and technical operations lead on <a href="https://caffeine.dd-decaf.eu">Caffeine</a>, a unique web platform which brings computer-aided design into the realm of metabolic engineering.</p>
            <p><a href="https://dd-decaf.eu">The project</a> was funded through the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en">EU Horizon 2020 programme</a>, and I joined halfway into its 4 year duration. In the final phase of the project, we were invited to participate in the <a href="https://bii.dk/news/meet-the-start-ups-metabolizer/">Business Acceleration Academy program</a> of the BioInnovation Institute in Copenhagen, with the aim to develop a business plan and validate the future commercial potential of the product beyond its EU funding phase. This resulted in <a href="https://youtu.be/v0OykuR2JbA?t=4127">Metabolyzer</a>, which has since joined forces with <a href="https://unseenbio.com">Unseen Bio</a>.</p>
            <p>As part of a 5 person team (a product owner, two bioinformaticians and two software engineers), I quickly received responsibility for large aspects of the project, including major architectural and technical decisions, collaboration and coordination with third party library communities, and fostering a culture of collecting data and metrics in order to make fact-based decisions.</p>

        <section>
          <p>I am an experienced software developer and IT operations engineer with a pragmatic approach and preference for stability over experimentation. My motivation comes mainly from building something of value and use to others. Although I can still appreciate the intrinsic beauty in a well designed algorithm, elegant data structure or clever expression of computational logic, I see software systems as a means to an end; any perfectly engineered application does not matter if nobody uses it.</p>
          <p>Having often worked in small teams with a large responsibility surface, I have out of necessity learned how to design low-maintenance systems. Instead of specializing in a narrow area, I learned how to be effective and productive across the stack. As a result, my standards for the development experience are very high: Short feedback cycles, stable, mature and battle-hardened software tools, well documented workflows and automation of mundane tasks. An application must be comprehensible and its behaviour transparent; to this end, automated testing, error reporting, logging, and metrics reporting are invaluable tools.</p>
          <p>A crucial fact in software development: Code is much, much harder to read than it is to write. Therefore, documentation, readability and maintainability are extremely important to me. Not only for the code we write, but also for the libraries we depend on. I prefer to utilize established, mature tools that work and do not surprise the user, rather than experimenting with the latest fad of the week. This approach allows developers to get the job done and keep focus on higher levels of abstraction.</p>
          <p>I am an avid Linux user who lives in the terminal. I invest a lot of time to learn the ins and outs of the tools I use regularly. For example, I use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">tiling window manager</a> and have learned most common operations in muscle memory, as well as the majority of the keybindings in my text editor. I find these skills essential in order to <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/06/05/smart-and-gets-things-done/">get things done</a> effectively and leave mental capacity for higher level ideas.</p>
          <p>I am patient and humble, and a reliable team player. I have a strong sense of fairness and value good reasoning over arguments from authority. Being an introvert and analytical by nature, I perform best on problems that are given due time for focus, deep work and reflection. An effective workplace needs to balance the need of close collaboration versus focused work, and I will not thrive in an environment which focuses solely on either extreme of that scale.</p>
